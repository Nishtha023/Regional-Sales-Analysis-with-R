# Regional-Sales-Analysis-with-R
This project examines regional sales performance through data visualization in R. By comparing total sales in four regions â€” Central, East, South, and West, I have reveal patterns and inconsistencies in business performance. The aim is to gain actionable insights to inform data-driven decision-making for regional strategy, marketing initiatives, and resource allocation. The visualizations give a concise and compelling picture of the distribution of sales, allowing stakeholders to see at a glance where the company is performing well and where it needs to improve.
